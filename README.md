A new begin, this time from the ground up by myself.
### Why?
Untill now I looked up other peoples work and tried to adapt it to what I have in mind with this.

Oke, I learned from it but was loosing time on it too. Often I had not only alter their code but also taking the errors out and updating it to the present standards.

#### My goal.
A cms that is fast, safe, lightweight and reliable. Is based on present standards, as much as possible  making use of vanilla PHP,JS and CSS.
